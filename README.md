# Open Knowledge Practices (OKP)
Open knowledge practices is a repository for collaborative work that enables people engaged in acquiring, generating and sharing knowledge in roles like student, teacher, researcher, scholar, and librarian to develop and demonstrate themselves (digital identities), their understandings (literacies), their skills, and their connections to other people (communities) throughout their lives, for their own benefit, for the common good, and to participate in a just and thriving economy.
