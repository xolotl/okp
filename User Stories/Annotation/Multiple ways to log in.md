As a user, I want to be able to change how I log in to annotate and access my annotations.

### Given that:
* I want to annotate web documents in various contexts (eg, both on the open web and from within other services/platforms like learning management systems (LMS) and content management systems (CMS)).
* I may change how I log in depending on:
** Context (eg, I might need to authenticate directly with annotation service on the open web, but via SSO when annotating within another service/platform).
** Changing external circumstances (eg, when using different devices, when my institutional affiliation changes).
** Convenience (eg, I might at times prefer to log in via social sign in, but at others via username/password).

### I want to log in to my annotation service using one or more authentication methods, for example:
* An identity related only to my annotation service itself (eg, a traditional email/password).
* An identity from another service of my choice (eg, an institutional ID, a 3rd-party ID like Google or Microsoft, a social login like Facebook, GitHub, or Twitter, etc).
* Via single sign on (SSO) when annotating from within other platforms/services.

### I want to be able to manage all the ways I log in to my annotation service.
* I may have started using my annotation service with traditional email/password authentication related only to the annotation service itself, but later might want to also/switch to authenticate using a different identity service.
* I may change or add authentication services and want to be able to log in to my existing annotation service using a new/different identity.
* In my annotation service, I need to to be able to:
** Manage multiple ways to log in (eg, view/add/update/delete authentication pathways associated with my account).
** Merge multiple existing accounts that might have different ways to log in (eg, merge an account associated with my institutional identity with an account associated with a social login identity).
