As a user, I want to annotate and access my annotations in multiple contexts without having to log in separately to my annotation service.

### Given that:
* I want to annotate various web documents within the context of other platforms/services (eg, within a learning management system (LMS) or content management system (CMS)).
* I log in to other platform/services with various identities (eg, native to a platform/service or via an external authentication service integrated into a platform/service (eg, AD, CAS, InCommon, LDAP, Shibboleth, social login, etc).
* I may sometimes also use my annotation service when I'm NOT within the context of other platforms/services (ie, just using a browser on the open web).

### I want to use my annotation service without having to log in to it separately.
* As soon as I am logged in to another platform/service with annotation capabilities, my annotation service should be ready to use and already connected to my existing/preferred account.

### I want to be able to disconnect, reconnect and change the connection between my platform/service identity and my annotation service. For example, when:
* For some reason my platform/service identity is not connecting to the right annotation service account.
* I need to change which annotation account my platform/service identity is connected to.
